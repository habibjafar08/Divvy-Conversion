## Latar Belakang
Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

> **Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders**. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno, the director of marketing, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

## Solusi
Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends. Moreno has set a clear goal: ***Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members***
